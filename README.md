# 🚀 Full-Stack MERN - MercuryERP - Modular HR System


Welcome to the **Full-Stack MERN Mini-Series**!  
This project walks through the essentials of building and deploying a MERN stack application step by step — perfect for anyone looking to quickly learn how to take a project from local development to live production.

## THIS DEPLOYMENT ONLY CONTAINS BACKEND and UNTESTED FRONTEND.
 WILL BE PUSHED BY OCT-10-25.  YOU CAN FORK THIS BACKEND AND BUILD YUOR OWN FRONT END REACT UI.

## 🎯 Series Overview

# Note: This repository contains the source code used throughout the this demo with video series. Each video builds upon the last, covering key topics in modern full-stack web development:

1. **Deploying your Node.js/Express Server to Railway**  
   Learn how to host your backend API on [Railway](https://railway.app) with ease.

2. **Connecting your MongoDB Atlas Database**  
   Set up a managed MongoDB cluster in [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) and connect it securely to your backend.

3. **Deploying your React Frontend (Netlify/Vercel)**  
   Deploy your React frontend to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and configure it to communicate with your live backend API.
